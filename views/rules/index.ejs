				<h2>About</h2>
				<p><strong>Jabis</strong> is a highly strategic game based off of <a href="http://www.pagat.com/climbing/bigtwo.html" target="_blank">Big2</a>. In fact, the rules are similar to those of Big2. The order of the cards from lowest to highest is 3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A-2. The main difference is that <strong>suits don't matter</strong>. You can't beat a 3 of clubs with a 3 of spades - you gotta play 4 or higher.</p>
				<p>The valid hands are singles, pairs, and 5 card hands - straights < full houses < four of a kind (+1 random card). <strong>No triples!</strong> Also, straights are now simple: they start lowest from 3 and end highest at 2. </p>
				<p>Whoever has the lowest card at the start of the game must play that card in their first hand (This is the only time suits do matter, and the order goes clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades)</p>
				<p>When everyone passes on a hand, the round is "cleared", the cards are turned over and added to the <strong>discard pile</strong>, and the player who played that hand can play whatever valid hand he wants.</p>
				<p>The game ends when everyone but the last person gets rid of all of his cards.</p>

				<h2>Scoring</h2>
				<p>
					Scoring is cumulative. When a player gets rid of all of his cards, the number of cards left in the game at that instant gets added to his current score.

			<p>
			<strong>5</strong> - For every 5 that you play, draw a card from the discard pile<br/>
			<strong>7</strong> - For every 7 that you play, give the next player a card from your hand<br/>
			<strong>8</strong> - Clear the round and go again<br/>
			<strong>10</strong> - For every 10 that you play, discard a card from your hand<br/>
			<strong>J</strong> - Play lower than the previous hand (until the turn comes back around to the player who most recently played a J)<br/>
			For example, Player 1 plays a pair of 7's.  This means he gives 2 cards to the next player<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Don't worry about memorizing what each of these cards do. You'll have reference to this in game.</strong><br/>
			Also, since J's may be confusing, you'll be notified when to play LOWER instead of higher.<br/>
			Finally, don't forget, <strong>suits don't matter!</strong></br>

				<h2>Examples</h2>
				<p>Here are some sample hands/plays just so you can get an idea of how Javis works.</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>Straight: 7-8-9-10-J</strong><br/>
					Pass a card to the next player (7), discard a card from your hand (10), clear the round and go again (8). Since round is cleared, J means nothing.<br/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>Full house: 5-5-5-7-7</strong><br/>
					Draw three cards (5), pass two cards to the next player (7)<br/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>Sample Play:</strong><br/>
					3 players - P1, P2, P3<br/>
					<br/>
					P1 plays a pair J<br/>
					P2 must play lower than P1's pair<br/>
					P3 must play lower than P2's pair<br/>
					P1 must play higher than P3's pair - <strong>since the turn returned to P1 (who was the most recent player who played a J), they start playing higher</strong><br/>
				</p>

			<div class="content" id="rules-hints">
				<h2>Hints</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Get rid of your 5's by playing them early in the game when there is nothing in the discard pile (so there's nothing to draw), passing them away (by playing 7s) or discarding them (by playing 10s)</li>
						<li>Try not to play a straight like J-Q-K-A-2 (or any high 5 card hand that contains a J). This might waste your 2, and chances are, someone has a lower straight than that. Up to you to take that risk.</li>
						<li>Don't pass cards in the beginning of the game. You might give the next player a full house or four of a kind.</li>
						<li>J's can be helpful if you know players after you have really high cards. But if the players have 8's, they can also take possession since you're allowing them to play lower</li>
					</ul>
